          <p class="text-wrap leading-200 text-md">Home-start’s approach is to support early intervention, as the early years are seen as the most important years, and every child deserves a good start in order to maximise their future potential.</p>

          <p class="text-md">We believe that the best possible start in life for a child begins at home with their family. A nurturing, loving, stable family and home environment strongly determines a child’s future life chances. Children whose parents are struggling to cope can miss out on the love, routine and support that are vital for their future.</p>
