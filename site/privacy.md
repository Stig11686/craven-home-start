We will not disclose any information to third parties without your explicit consent, unless there are exceptional circumstances, such as when the health or safety of others is at risk or where the law requires the disclosure of information.

As part of our funding we may also need to share statistical and general information from your records with other organisations and funding bodies. This information will be anonymised to ensure your identify cannot be established.

Technology allows us to protect information in a number of ways, in the main by restricting access. Our guiding principle is that we are holding your information in strict confidence. Information provided in confidence will only be used for the purposes to which you consent to, unless there are other circumstances covered by the law.
